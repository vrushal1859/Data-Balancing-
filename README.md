Data Balancing using CMTNN and SMOTE for Credit Card Fraud Detection 
This Research presents an innovative approach towards detecting fraudulent credit card transactions. A commonly prevailing yet dominant problem faced in detection of fraudulent credit card transactions is the scarce occurrence of such fraudulent transactions with respect to legitimate (authorized) transactions. Therefore, any data that is recorded will always have a stark imbalance in the number of minority (fraudulent) and majority (legitimate) class samples. This imbalanced distribution of the training data among classes makes it hard for any learning algorithm to learn the features of the minority class. Thus, the Research presented the practical implementation of how to handle the Imbalanced classification using Machine Learning and Deep Learning Approaches
